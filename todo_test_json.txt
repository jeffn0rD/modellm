Reasoning:
Main Actors:
• Single end-user who manages their own tasks.
• Local browser-based to-do application itself as an active software component.
• (Future) Multi-device sync mechanism as an optional active component handling synchronization.
• (Future) Smart suggestion mechanism as an analytical/recommendation component.


Main DataEntities:
• Core: Task, Category, Task List View, Filter Settings, Sort Settings, Default View Configuration, Local Task Store.
• Future: Task Priority, Reminder, Notification, Recurring Task, Recurrence Pattern, Tag, Saved View, Task Export File, Analytics Summary, Sync Configuration, Theme/Appearance Settings.
• Excluded: Multi-User Account, Authentication Credentials, Shared List, External Integration Configuration.


Main Actions:
• Core task lifecycle: create/edit/delete tasks; mark complete/incomplete.
• Organize tasks into categories and manage category lifecycle.
• View tasks in main list; filter and sort; remember view preferences; automatically save data.
• Future: set priorities, configure reminders, define recurrence, manage tags and saved views, export/import tasks, search tasks, compute analytics, configure/perform multi-device sync, generate smart suggestions, and customize theming/layout.
• Excluded actions around multi-user, authentication, collaboration, mobile, and external integrations are modeled and tagged as `"excluded"`.


I merged closely related C* hints (e.g., all filter/sort preferences into single FilterSettings/SortSettings entities and corresponding actions) and kept UI-specific concepts as either UI-tagged DataEntities (like TaskListView, SavedView) or actions (ConfigureDefaultView, CustomizeLayout). Non-functional expectations (performance, offline, privacy) are not turned into actions or entities except where they clearly imply an active component (SyncEngine) or a configured state (SyncConfiguration). Future and excluded concepts are marked with `"future"` or `"excluded"` plus other relevant categories.

Reasoning:
I’ll group concepts into: core task and category lifecycles; the main list view/interaction flow; persistence and autosave services; future feature families (priorities, reminders/recurrence, richer org/search, export/import, analytics/suggestions, sync, theming); plus a high-level “Core Single-User Local App” aggregation. Lifecycles and view flows are ordered to reflect typical usage (create → edit → complete/incomplete → delete; load view → filter/sort → persist preferences). Future sets group related actions/entities so they can be implemented as coherent packages.

Reasoning:
I’ll model messages between the human user and the app (A1 ↔ A2), plus internal-style messages where useful (A2 ↔ A2 or with A3/A4 in future). I’ll focus messages around the key aggregations: TaskLifecycle (AG1), CategoryLifecycle (AG2), MainListViewFlow (AG4), ViewPreferencePersistenceFlow (AG5), PersistenceAndAutosaveService (AG6), and the major future feature sets (AG10–AG14). For each user-visible action, I create a command/request from EndUser to TodoApplication and a corresponding response/event from the app back to the user. For background services (autosave, sync, suggestions), I model events/commands with appropriate producers/consumers as implied by Actors. MessageAggregations then string these messages into ordered workflows aligned with each AG’s intent.

Reasoning:
I derived one or a small cluster of requirements per anchor, grouping only when the text clearly refers to one coherent capability (e.g., all filtering/sorting options) or one non-functional theme (e.g., privacy, offline). Types are mapped from anchor types and semantics:
• Core capabilities → functional (`FR-*`).
• Non-functional constraints → nonfunctional (`NFR-*`).
• Pure UI style expectations → `ui` (`UI-*`).
• Future-capability anchors → `future-functional` (`FR-FUT-*`).
• Explicit exclusions → `excluded` (`EX-*`).


Section hints follow the spec’s section numbers. `relatedConcepts` are taken from Concepts.json, based on overlapping anchors and semantics; I include main Actors, the central DataEntities, and sometimes key Actions. `relatedMessages` come from Messages.json, again by overlapping anchors and semantics. Where a future feature has detailed messaging (search, sync, smart suggestions), I link them. Priorities are set to `"must"` for clearly core behavior/non-functionals, `"could"` for wish-list future features, and omitted where ambiguous. Each significant anchor is covered at least once.
