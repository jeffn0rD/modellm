## Project Overview

**Project Type:** Python Application

## Key Files

**Documentation:**

## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use snake_case for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate
- clean up the directories of test scripts and temporary use tools when tasks are completed.
  - if tools are useful enough to use again save them to the `agents/tools` or `agents/tests` folder.
  - note unit tests and validations should be saved elsewhere

## Testing
- all code needs at least 80% test coverage
- all newly generated code needs to pass all tests before the task can be considered complete
- there is a TypeQL test database server at `http://localhost:8000` creds: admin/password
  - it is a docker container for test purposes
